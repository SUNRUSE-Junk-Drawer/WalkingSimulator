# firstPerson

A camera instance is an object containing:

- transform: A transform matrix to apply this frame.
- transformPreviousDraw: A transform matrix to apply the previous frame.

    matrix = require "./../matrix.litcoffee"
    vector = require "./../vector.litcoffee"
    navmesh = require "./../navmesh.litcoffee"
    misc = require "./../misc.litcoffee"
    plane = require "./../plane.litcoffee"

## create

- An object equivalent to the "gamepad" module.
- A navmesh instance to track.
- A vector specifying the initial location of the camera.
- The initial yaw, in radians.
- The initial pitch, in radians.
- The speed, in units per tick, at which the camera may move horizontally.
- The speed, in radians per tick, at which the camera may yaw.
- The speed, in radians per tick, at which the camera may pitch.
- The height above the ground at which to place the camera.

Returns a new camera instance.

        locationCopy = []

## tick

- A camera instance.

        cameraInstance.pitch += (cameraInstance.gamepad.up - cameraInstance.gamepad.down) * cameraInstance.pitchSpeed
        cameraInstance.pitch = Math.min (Math.PI / 2), Math.max (Math.PI / -2), cameraInstance.pitch

        forward = (cameraInstance.gamepad.forward - cameraInstance.gamepad.backward) * cameraInstance.speed
        cameraInstance.location[0] += (Math.sin cameraInstance.yaw) * forward
        cameraInstance.location[2] += (Math.cos cameraInstance.yaw) * forward

        side = (cameraInstance.gamepad.right - cameraInstance.gamepad.left) * cameraInstance.speed
        cameraInstance.location[0] += (Math.cos cameraInstance.yaw) * side
        cameraInstance.location[2] -= (Math.sin cameraInstance.yaw) * side

        cameraInstance.triangle = navmesh.constrain cameraInstance.location, cameraInstance.triangle
        plane.project cameraInstance.triangle.plane, cameraInstance.location, cameraInstance.location

        return

## preDraw

- A camera instance.
- The progress through the current tick, where "0" is the previous tick and "1"
  is the new tick.

    interpolatedLocation = []

    preDraw = (cameraInstance, progress) ->
        if not cameraInstance.firstDraw
            matrix.copy cameraInstance.transform, cameraInstance.transformPreviousDraw

        matrix.rotateX (misc.interpolate cameraInstance.previousPitch, cameraInstance.pitch, progress), cameraInstance.transform

        matrix.translate [0, 0, 0], cameraInstance.transform
