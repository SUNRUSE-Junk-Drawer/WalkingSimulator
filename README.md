It appears to be some kind of walking simulator ~shamelessly ripping off~ 
inspired by the likes of 
[LSD Dream Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD_(video_game)) and 
[Bernband](http://gamejolt.com/games/bernband/34864)!

It also appears to not yet be working.  Perhaps come back later?

See [MasSplat](https://github.com/jameswilddev/MasSplat) for the engine used to 
build this.
